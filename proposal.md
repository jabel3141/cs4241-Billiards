For our project we are going to analyze the results of the WPI Cue Sports Club's Billiards Exam and visualize the results several different ways.
Some ways we plan to do this are:

* Search by name to view results for individual sections of the exam
* Plot graphs correleating if people did as well on some sections compared to other sections
* Look for indivual sections and show high scores and who they are by
* Show each member's scores as a radar chart
